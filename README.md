# GECkO
The official GECo Discord bot.

It currently only supports a user lookup on the website but it should support the intranet in the future providing useful functions such as:
* Tournament information look-up or announcements
* Tournament management (Team matching, reminders etc.) with [Toornament4J](https://github.com/VSETH-GECO/Toornament4J)
* Map Veto for games like CS:GO and Overwatch (WIP)
* Website News and Events synchronization (Done, waiting for web implementation)
